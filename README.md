# XYZ Reader

The XYZ Reader is the fourth project in the Udacity's Android Dev Nanodegree.

## Project Overview

## What Will I Learn?

Through this project, you will:

    Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
    Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
    Separate an interface into surfaces.
    Effectively use transitions and motion.
